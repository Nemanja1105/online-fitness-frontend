<h1>Description:</h1>
This repository contains the source code of the main application of the system used for providing and searching for online fitness programs. The application is developed using Angular 17 with the assistance of Bootstrap 5, Angular Material, and Apex Chart libraries.

The application enables users to browse and participate in various fitness programs. Each program has a name, description, category (e.g., cardio, strength, flexibility, HIIT), basic common properties (price, difficulty level, duration), location (e.g., online, gym, park), images, instructor information, and contact details. The administrative application allows the definition of all possible categories, properties, and attributes of fitness programs.

Users can search for programs and filter them according to various criteria. Programs are displayed as cards, and clicking on a card opens up details on a new page. Users can ask questions, and all communication for a specific program is displayed to all users as comments.

Unregistered users can search for programs and view details but cannot ask questions or participate in programs. Registration is done by filling out a form with basic information, and after successful registration, the user has access to all application functionalities through the menu.

Registered users can review previous participation in programs, purchase them, and more. They can communicate with each other via messages and send messages to advisors for program selection.

The homepage of the application displays an RSS feed with the latest news and information from the fitness world, as well as daily exercise suggestions with instructions. Registered users can maintain their activity diary, track exercise results and progress, and the application allows graphical representation of progress and downloading the activity diary as a PDF document. Additionally, users are offered the option to subscribe to a specific category, where subscribed users receive new programs created for that category once a day.
